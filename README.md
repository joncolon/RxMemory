- Used RxJava 2 to chain Retrofit calls and Room SQLite Database queries and manage the state of the UI accordingly. All information is stored in Room before being distributed to the view. 
- Structured the app using Model-View-ViewModel architecture using RxJava 2 to pass state and Dagger 2 for dependency injection
- Implemented a custom ItemAnimator to trigger animations upon data changes in the RecyclerView
- Used Data-Binding and custom Binding Adapters to pass photo urls through xml to be processed by Glide.
